You can just open index.html file in your browser or use Live Server extension in VSCode.

## My Approach

I tried to make everything as dynamic as i could. When the code executes, i used an IIFE to create dynamic event listeners with required parameters attached to them. Meanwhile, to make a cleaner JavaScript structure, i made my functions "pure functions". This way i was able to seperate some chunks of my code to different files, both making it look cleaner and more importantly, modular. 

While i prefer using SASS, i didn't want to include it to make it native aswell.
